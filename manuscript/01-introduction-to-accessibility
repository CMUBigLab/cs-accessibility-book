## Ability Assumptions

Accessibility is fundamentally about assumptions built into our environments, including the digital ones.

Using computers is a vital part of life, and not everyone uses computers in the ways that they are commonly built assuming people will use them. Correcting for this is the underlying principle of accessibility.

Making computer systems accessible is fundamentally tied to how they are built.

Researchers and developers of interactive systems have always made ability assumptions as a kind of tradeoff in being able to create a system that works at all.

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) embodies a popular and common set of assumptions. Most notably, "Graphical" implies the ability to see the interface's content. Generally, motor abilities are often assumed.

In recent years, speech has become a popular interaction modality with the rise of voice agents. In this case, the assumption is that someone will not only be able to speak, but also be able to speak in a way that the automatic speech recognition can understand.

## Making Documents and Applications Accessible

The focus of this book is not on how to make documents and applications accessible, but rather on how access technology itself is created. Fortunately, there are numerous books and websites that describe at length how to make documents and applications accessible. Nevertheless, it is useful to understand how to make documents and applications accessible

## Practice Making a Web Page Accessible

While our focus in this book isn't on how to make documents and applications accessible, it is still valuable to go through the mechanics of doing so. Making a web page accessible drives home what developers must do to make their web pages (and, generally, applications) accessible to the assistive technologies that are available.
