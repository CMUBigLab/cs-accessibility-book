aggressively, cs is about interface, cs is about pretending to be about interaction


# Introduction to Accessibility




1. What is accessibility?
2. What is meant by accessibility?
3. Metadata for form and function
4. Making media accessible
5. Making dynamic content accessible
6. Making desktop applications accessible
7. Making mobile experiences accessible


# Building Access Technologies

Each of these chapters introduces a different kind of access technology, describes how it is built, what challenges it introduces, and contains one or more "building" assignments where students create a version of the access technology and work through issues with those challenges.

1. Architectures, Data Structures, and Algorithms for User Interfaces
   - a high-level technical introduction to GUI systems
   - introduction of common data structures in UI (e.g., UI trees)
   - introduction to algorithms for UI, e.g., layout engines, renderers, etc.
   - explore concepts through browser extension, web DOM, browser layout engine
2. Magnification
   - discussion of the three main types of magnification (graphical zoom, content reflow, per item)
   - build three kinds of magnification in web browser, explore tradeoffs
3. Screen Readers
   - history of screen readers (why name, early terminal ones, first GUI, adoption to the web, mobile ... technical changes with each level)
   - modern screen reader implemenation (work over UI trees)
   - build screen reader for the web
   - challenges with screen reader UI (learning so many shortcuts)

4. Switch Input
   - introduce switch input, control a whole GUI with one (or several) switches
   - discuss algorithms for navigating a huge 2d space with one switch (e.g., grids, line scanning, target by target, etc.)
   - implement scanning and/or other approaches

5. Assistive Pointing and Touch
   - some people have a harder time than others choosing specific targets due to dexterity issues
   - we can assist if we know where targets are, how do we reliably find targets?
   - connections to Fitts's Law
   - implement various touch/pointing strategies

6. Reading Support
   - 
7. Alternative and Augmentative Communication
   - 
8. Eye Tracking
   - 

9. In the Operating System



How Operating Systems are designed to enable accessibility.
